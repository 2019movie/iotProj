# iotProj
iotProj: AT3 Project (PRJ) - V2.1 
# Project description
The system will consist of a carpark, sensors and displays to track car entering the exiting of carpark. Keep track of available parking bays.

The system develop in Python using PyCharm IDE

The system generate 2 files. "config.json" holds configurations when carpark initialised. 
log file created to keep the information of carpark activity, each entry hold the number plate with activities with timestamp.

# Summary of project
The project is a simulation of a smart car park system with object oriented programming principles (e.g. inheritance, polymorphism and abstract classes). It utilise number of sensors such as sensors detecting vehicles with ability to detect license plates. The system equip with display to notify user with relevant information.

## car park functionalities
The smart car park system perform vehicle management operation. Cars entering and exiting the car park are detected by sensors (Entry and Exit sensor). The car park's internal state update in real-time.
Real-time information also output to the display, such as message, number of available bays, other relavant data (e.g. temperature)
